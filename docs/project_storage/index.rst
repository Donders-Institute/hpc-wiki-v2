The project storage
*******************

Researches at DCCN are organised as projects. Research data associated with projects are centrally organised on the **project storage**.

Each project receives a specific directory on the project storage, and it is accessible on the HPC cluster, via the path ``/project/<the_project_id>``.  For example, the storage for project ``3010000.01`` is under the path ``/project/3010000.01``.
