Running supported software in the cluster
*****************************************

Commonly used data analysis/process software are centrally managed and supported in the cluster. A list of the supported software can be found `here <http://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=torque-software>`_. The repository where the software are organised and installed is mounted to the ``/opt`` directory on every cluster node.

.. tip::

    You are welcomed to take initiative for a new software in the repository if you think the software is/will be beneficial to most of the HPC users.  See :ref:`software-maintainer` for more detail.
