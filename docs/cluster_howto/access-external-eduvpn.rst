Using eduVPN
************

`EduVPN <https://www.surf.nl/en/eduvpn-facilitate-secure-internet-access-everywhere>`_ is a virtual private network service provided by SURF allowing secure access to institute's protected network, services and systems.

It is the most straight forward way of accessing the HPC cluster from outside of the DCCN network.  It requires a valid Radboud University Account (i.e. the account name is in email format with either ``@donders.ru.nl`` or ``@ru.nl`` in suffix) and the `Microsoft Authenticator application <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/mobile-authenticator-app>`_ for the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).  For more details, you can follow the `instruction <https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=eduvpn>`_ to setup the eduVPN.

After you start the eduVPN connection, your computer is "virtually" part of the DCCN network.  With that you can connect directly to the HPC cluster as :ref:`accessing from inside of DCCN <getting_access_to_the_hpc_cluster>`.
