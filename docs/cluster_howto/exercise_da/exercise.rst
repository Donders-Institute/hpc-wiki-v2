Exercise: distributed data analysis
***********************************

This exercise mimics a data analysis scheme assuming that we have a dataset acquired from 6 subjects; and we want to perform an analysis algorithm on each subject's data independently.

You will be given the dataset (with fake data) and the already implemented analysis algorithm in different languages.  Your task is to run the analysis over the dataset in parallel using the torque cluster.
