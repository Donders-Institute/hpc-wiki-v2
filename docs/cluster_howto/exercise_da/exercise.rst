Exercise: distribute data analysis in the Torque cluster
********************************************************

This exercise mimics a distributed data analysis assuming that we want to apply the same data analysis algorithm independently on a dataset acquired from 6 subjects.

You will be given the dataset (with fake data) and the already implemented analysis algorithm.  Your task is to run the analysis over the dataset in parallel using the torque cluster.
