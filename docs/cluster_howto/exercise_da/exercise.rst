Exercise: distributed data analysis
***********************************

This exercise mimics a data analysis scenario assuming that we have a dataset acquired from multiple subjects; and we want to perform an analysis algorithm on each subject's data independently.

You will be given a dataset (with fake data) and an analysis algorithm implemented in various languages/tools.  Your task is to run the analysis over the dataset in parallel using the torque cluster.
